§622.369   Description of zones and subzones.

(b) Migratory groups of Spanish mackerel—(1) Gulf migratory group. In the EEZ, the Gulf
migratory group is bounded by a line extending east of the US/Mexico border and a line
extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary. See Table 2 of this
section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 3 in Appendix G of this part for
illustration.

(2) Atlantic migratory group. In the EEZ, the Atlantic migratory group is bounded by a
line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary and a line extending
from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in
§600.105(a) of this chapter). The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern
and southern zones. See Table 2 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure
3 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See §622.385(b)(1) for a description of
the areas for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel commercial trip limits.

(i) Northern zone. The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line
extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as
described in §600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North
Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in §622.2, including the EEZ off each state
from North Carolina to New York.

(ii) Southern zone. The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line
extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in §622.2, and north
of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary, including the
EEZ off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
